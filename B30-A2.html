        Be Water My Friend. <br />
        This is what I decided to name this track, even though it's made entirely of loops that aren't mine <br />
        (I guess, if they're royalty-free then maybe I could get away with it, if Justice used loops in some of their songs, why can't I)? <br />
        Regardless of this, I thought this was going to be a bit of a challenge because of all loops I would need to listen to. <br />
        What I did about this though, was to simply settle on a combination of 2-3 loops I'd find and add others around that. <br />
        This felt very similar to putting Lego pieces together, and I do enjoy building stuff with Legos. <br />
        However, I had some time limitations and knew I couldn't explore way too much, so I endedn up with this phrase: <br />
    </p>

        I found this sample called 'Underwater Synth Progression Bb Minor 85 BPM', I really liked how atmospheric it was. <br />
        The pad sound reminded me of something from a 90s Sega underwater level, or a Frank Ocean song. I wanted to build of of that. <br />
        I should mention that I used the keyword 'BPM' to search for loops, just to get a feel for loops without necessarily having to listen to them all. <br/>
        Eventually, I found a loop called 'Pluck Pad Progression Dm 121 BPM', liked it, and then I pitched the first loop down to match the second. <br />
        Suddenly, I was in the lost city of Atlantis. <br />

        After chopping the main loops up a bit, I found a very trip hop-sounding drum beat and added that in as the main rhythm. <br />
        There's also a loop from an instrument called a 'pandeiro' which gives the song a shaky, almost exotic feel. <br />
        I then added some guitar loops, and it was at that point where the track became less of a trip hop track and more of a 'lofi beats to study with' kind of track. <br />
        Genrewise, this isn't how I typically approach music-making but I was not at all dissatisfied, I did want to shake things up a bit though, which is why I added the key change. <br/>
        Now that the song was in full lofi hip hop mode, something was missing. I got to a point where the track felt like it needed indication that the vibe was going to change. <br />
        This is where things really got intereting for me, because I started looking for effects loops and got creative with how to complement the vibes with them. <br />
        I found a vinyl scratch loop which I felt would fit pretty well, I was a bit sour about it because I felt it made the section changes a little too obvious. <br />
        I also used a wind sample and a synth noise sample, to add ocean wave and underwater textures respectively. <br />
        In total, I used a total of 9 loops for the entire track. <br />
    </p>

        Since my initial focus had been on getting some good-sounding phrases going, I felt like I was at a good spot with how everything sounded. <br />
        I did want to add some effects while also not taking away from the track's feel too much, but at the same time I felt like some small details could be better. <br />
        The synth pads and percussion were right where I wanted them and the effects would have benefitted more from panning, so I focused on the guitars. <br />
        The plucked loop was already funky, but if I made it watery-funky then that could have maybe complemented the song's 'underwater' feel. <br />
        This is why I ended up choosing a chorus effect for it, and while I set it to where the effect is a bit subtle, it adds a necessary 'spice' to the loop. <br />
        I also added some reverb to the riff loop (officially called 'Loveline'), which really made it more 'washy' and helped it bleed into the background more. <br />

        This has to have been the toughest part for me, because even though I've heard good uses of fader and panning manipulation before, I strongly felt like sound was at a really good spot. <br />
        Starting with the pads, I panned the underwater loop more to the left and the plucked pad more to the right. <br />
        I really wanted to create a sense of a surrounding atmosphere, and pushing the underwater loop more to the left felt like it would do that, but I also wanted to balance that out. <br />
        I liked where the drum kit was at in terms of volume so I lowered down the pandeiro sample a bit-just to accent the kit more. <br />
        With the guitars, I wanted to take advantage of the reverb on the Loveline loop for the song's atmosphere, which is why I panned it left with the underwater loop. <br />
        The plucked guitar loop needed to contrast the loveline loop at this stage, so I though of having it serve as a bit of a one-ear ticking pattern to make the song more 'quirky'. <br />
        This is why I panned that loop more to the right, and I ended up doing the same with the scratch sample. It really adds to the surprise effect of the scratch loop coming in out of nowhere. <br />
        By this point I had a larger focuson the atmospheric sounds playing a bit more towards the left ear while the more melodic and one-off sounds were more to the right. <br />
        I wanted to break structure a bit, so I ended up pushing my wind sample a bit more to the left. I found that this added to the 'surprise' factor of the song a bit. <br />
