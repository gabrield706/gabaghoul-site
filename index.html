        The official gabaghoul website. I'm a producer located in California.<br />
        My influences draw from many places, including metal, goth, latin, <br />
        alternative hip hop, and IDM. I mostly do this for fun but I'll have to <br />
        wear a mask or something if I accidentally get famous (I do value my privacy). <br />
        Se habla Espa√±ol.</p>
