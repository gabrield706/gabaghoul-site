    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        I made a small recording based on the song "Alma" by Gustavo Cerati <br />
        It's a primarily electronic track and I wanted to try to recreate some of the main sounds using Ableton's Analog virtual synth<br />
        I recreated the main melody, bassline, and secondary melody using a different patch for each which I'll further discuss below. <br />
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        From hearing the main melody, the timbre remotely sounde like a square wave one and it was kind of harmonic. <br />
        I went with using 2 square wave oscillators to recreate the sound, pitching osc1 an octave above. I also increased the pulse width on osc1 a bit <br />
        (just to add a bit of extra 'buzzy' texture that it seems to have on the track). <br />
    </p>

        For the bassline, it sounded like a static pad so I didn't feel like I would have to change much in regards to wave form. <br />
        I only used one square wave (osc1) for this patch and increased the attack to 126ms-just because that soft rise felt obvious to me. <br />

        The timbre for the secondary melody was the hardest thing for me to recreate; I know the sound is a lot more 'bleepy,'  <br />
        but as I tweaked the filter settings on analog (applying LPF), I wasn't getting the result I was aiming for. <br />
        I chose to use two square wave oscillators for this one because that 'bleepyness' just sounded remotely square. <br />
        I tuned the second oscillator 2 octaves down to give it some bass, and I really shortened the attack and leveled the  <br />
        sustain enough to strike a sweet spot with how short those notes were being played. While I lacked with this part  <br />
        I didn't feel that my overall result was bad.  <br />
