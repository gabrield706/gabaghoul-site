        As far as an individual aesthetic, I’ve been thinking of using darkwave or Eastern-European post-punk-inspired aesthetics <br />
        as a sort of ‘jumping off point’ for my own. The whole ‘doomerwave’ internet subculture was kicked off by bands such as <br />
        Molchat Doma, who typically wear all-black outfits that include long coats, leather jackets, and black jeans or chinos. <br />
        All of their members also have facial hair, and while that’s not the reason for why I personally chose to grow out a beard, <br />
        I guess that’s an aesthetic plus for me now haha. Molchat Doma’s aesthetically definitely reminds me of my own to a certain degree; <br />
        I tend to wear a good amount of black clothing but in my case this comes more from a place of fashion minimalism and my own aesthetic laziness. <br />
        However, I am considering that I should maybe buy a leather jacket or long coat to spice things up a bit. <br />

        Given that dark, gothic techno sound that a lot of Molchat Doma’s songs tend to have, my guess is that their sound and aesthetic <br />
        might be largely influenced by some of the classic post-punk bands of the late 70s and early 80s that featured a similar sound <br />
        and aesthetic. In my list of top 10 artists I mention 2 of these classic goth/post-punk bands: Joy Division and The Cure. <br />
        Both of these bands were pretty much well-associated with their fashion sense in addition to their music: Joy Divison’s members <br />
        often wore button-up shirts and jeans (a more ‘working class’ aesthetic) while The Cure is not only notorious for Robert Smith’s <br />
        iconic hairstyle, but also for the black clothing their members would often wear. While you can see elements of both bands’ visual <br />
        aesthetics in the outfits of bands like Molchat Doma, I would however, follow those outfit choices to a certain degree. A lot of the <br />
        modern darkwave sounds are rooted in nostalgia for the more gothic sounds of the 80s and 90s. While I enjoy those types of sounds, <br />
        I would want my project to reflect our current time-or even something ahead of our time. <br />

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        I know, I know, I previously mentioned wanting to move away form nostalgia. But at the same time I’ve been shaped by a lot of these 90s/2000s <br />
        future aesthetics that a lot of my aesthetic vision is shaped by media pieces like these. Growing up, I’ve been exposed to some particular <br />
        music videos inspired by industrial robotics and machinery. Now that AI is becoming more predominant in our everyday lives, I’ve been coming back <br />
        to these videos much more, and wouldn’t be surprised if this influences my creative direction with things like promotional tour art or even album covers. <br />
        I’ve also had these vague memories of futuristic fashion trends from the early 2000s, and have also seen a nostalgic resurgence for cyberwave-inspired fashion and design. <br />
        Outside of my own artistic outfit, I think I’m in a bit of a conundrum about how an aesthetic past will influence my own proposition for the future. <br />
