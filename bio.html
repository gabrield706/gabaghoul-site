        Hi, Iâ€™m Gabriel Diaz, also known as ghouligan. I'm a former software developer trying his hand at a long-time passion. My musical influences draw from many genres, including post-punk, Latin, trip hop, shoegaze, metal, psychedelic rock, and ambient. 
    </p>

        I've been playing guitar since I was 9 and have played in bands throughout high school. I studied computer engineering right after but had no time for music. We can't have that now can we?
