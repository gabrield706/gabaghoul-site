            "Demise": <br />
            <br />
            Under the night <br />
            Across the sand <br />
            Lies a heart that no other could bind <br />
            To be found again and wander alone <br />
            Is out of mind, if not to suffer more <br />

            <br />
            Absent of stars <br />
            Through winds that burn <br />
            I see your image over waters that fade  <br />
            Ever-present thirst is nothing to fight <br />
            Once I find, what was mine before <br />

        I had this song idea for a long time now but always struggled to give it the right lyrics.
        Listening to it always gives me a sensation of someone wandering a desert in the midst of delirium. It's
        not just the occasional mirage that this person hallucinates, but, in a more metaphorical sense, visions
        and ideas of a past lover that this person can't come to grips with. This person is seeking something in
        a vast desert that they could never obtain before falling victim to the desert's unbareable conditions.
        <br />
        While I did have some sort of pre-existing idea about the lyircs, this whole concept fell into the territory
        of 'I am lost and dying without you.' I would have to say this is the underlying universal feeling, except
        that I guess I kind of worked backwards in a way. However, I didn't want to limit myself to phrases like
        'I'm lost in a desert without you' or 'I'm wandering around and dying of thirst without you,' that sort of thing.
        As ususal, I wanted to strive for a good degree of vagueness with the lyrics, but I will have to admit this also
        was challenging with the mental image I strived to paint for this song.
        <br />
        I tried focusing on details a bit more. Lines such as 'through winds that burn' and 'ever-present thirst'
        suggest some sort of literal suffering that is really meant to be metaphorical. I think they complement
        the music well enough while possibly adding some level of vagueness as to whether the suffering in question
        is literal or not.
