            "Coco Levante": <br />
            <br />
            (Verse I) <br />
            tired I lie <br />
            fruits of my life <br />
            everything I know <br />
            <br />

            the things others say <br />
            dry me away <br />
            better left alone <br />
            <br />

            (Pre-chorus) <br />
            cause everything’s just fine <br />
            everyone’s troubles aren’t mine <br />
            and I couldn’t give a damn about it anyway <br />
            <br />

            (Chorus) <br />
            No one in my life <br />
            I’m not gonna break it <br />
            <br />

            Everything’s alright <br />
            Nothing I’d be faking <br />
            <br />

            One more day alive <br />
            My time won’t be wasted on you <br />
            <br />

            cause you’re a loss for all I know <br />
            <br />

            (Verse II) <br />
            <br />

            When everyone’s gone and the noises are over <br />
            Life is always moving forward <br />
            <br />

            No troubles around me <br />
            Though drama’s surrounding <br />
            peace of mind makes me feel alive <br />
            <br />

            (Chorus) <br />
            No one in my life <br />
            I’m not gonna break it <br />
            <br />

            Everything’s alright <br />
            Nothing I’d be faking <br />
            <br />

            One more day alive <br />
            My time won’t be wasted on you <br />
            <br />

            (Bridge)
            <br />

            And maybe it might be getting lonely <br />
            But everyone just disappoints me <br />
            Is it really my problem <br />
            When others can’t solve theirs <br />
            Then they can go to hell with their pettiness along <br />
            <br />

            (Outro)
            <br />

            Da da du du da da da du du <br />
            Da da du du du <br />
            x3 <br />
            <br />

            
        </p>

        This is another song I've had for a while but could never find lyrics for.
        Since it's fairly upbeat, I figured I could give it a go with lyrics from the unreliable narrator perspective.
        I settled on writing from the perspective of someone who just couldn't stand being aroud people-someone with an antisocial drive <br />
        That comes from the place of constantly being disappointed by the things people say and do, to the point of wanting
        to shut eveyone out of their life. This person really values the idea of individual progress and not dealing with
        things that are otherwise trivial, but while this person has rid themselves of a social life, they do find themselves lonely. 
        This is evident during the bridge when the speaker claims it might be 'getting lonely,' but they still try to maintain
        the facade of someone who doesn't need anyone in their life. 
        <br />
        They lyrics were inspired by a few people I came across in my life, and to some extent, certain experiences from my own life.
        Sometimes, some of us tend to get so caught up with things like self-fulfillment and personal realization, that we might
        find ourselves growing more and more intolerant towards others. This isn't to say that toxicity doesn't exist within people,
        but maybe sometimes we might need to embrace the more trivial things like leaving your house a bit dirty
        if it means going to see an old-friend, watching a movie with good company even if they chew potato chips too loudly, etc.
        <br />
        I didn't quite know how to tackle the lyrical melodies since my voice tends to be better for darker songs,
        and this one felt a lot more upbeat. I made this during a time where I was really into emulating Tame Impala sounds,
        and the only thing that occurred to me was to try singing like Kevin Parker. I tried making the vocal rhythms more
        'bouncier' than usual since that's something I noticed he does, but it didn't feel too right when I tried singing that way.
        I also noticed that there plenty of times where my voice follows a major scale patter, which also
        didn't sit quite right with my 'spooky' voice. However, this just felt right for the song, but I wouldn't
        say the result is captivating enough for me to really get into the song, as a listener. I do however, really like
        the 'da's' near the end of the song, I like how the reverb them a bit of extra texture.
