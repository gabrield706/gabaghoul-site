        I found it really intriguing how it was that MIDI messages were made up. <br />
        Even though I wasn't too prepared for a bitwise analysis of certain MIDI messages, I really enjoyed that as a computer engineering grad.<br />
        A lot of the base-2 and hexadecimal concepts were easy to grasp, but I'm still curious about other types of MIDI messages. <br />
        From my own experiences trying to configure MIDI controllers to DAWs, I'm aware that there are certain MIDI messages called CC messages, <br />
        they usually correspond to assigning buttons, knobs, or sliders to certain parameters but I'm wondering if those would be different than status messages. <br />
        Probably because note messages tend to be categorized differently than CC messages, and we've just seen that note and status data is a part of status messages. <br />

        For a while, I never really understood what 'MIDI Thru' was used for, but I think the status message break down really put it into perspective.  <br />
        My understanding is that because a channel message will specify what instrument will receive that MIDI message, said message could get bypassed if it's not for the first instrument in a linear routing. <br />
        If the next instrument receiving MIDI from the first instrument's MIDI thru is the correct instrument, then it will act accordingly.  <br />
        Of course, if a MIDI message is for instrument 1 then nothing has to go out of MIDI thru or the message won't affect the next instrument.  <br />
        My idea was always that chaining two MIDI instruments together would look more like a controller going into MIDI in of instrument 1,  <br />
        and its MIDI out would go into instrument 2's MIDI in. Maybe that's a possibility, but I'm guessing having a MIDI thru would make  <br />
        sense if instrument 1's MIDI out is exclusively for sending MIDI messages generated by instrument 1.  <br />
