            "my shining path": <br />
            <br />
            (Pre-Chorus) <br />
            And I could wonder if we'd meet again <br />
            Had everyone cared in your life <br />
            Would we open up if both our paths just <br />
            Weren't so different at all? <br />

            <br />
            (Chorus) <br />
            Cause if this is your song <br />
            I've been making along <br />
            Then I've wased my time <br />
            On a worthless mind <br />
            That could never come cold <br />
            If things went foretold  <br />
            Cause all I ever had <br />
            Was a shining path <br />

            
        </p>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        This is a song I've been wanting to make for a while. To say the least, the lyrics are for a deceased relative.
        This is as personal as I ever hope to get when writing lyrics.
        <br />
        The reason I came to using this theme was partly to take advantage of the momentum, but also because the idea for
        the chorus sort of came up one night. I was playing back the instrumental one night and naturally ended up humming
        some stuff along. That's when the 'this is your song, I've been making along' part came up. I was reluctant to use
        that rhyme out of respet for the subject matter, but no other words felt right to convey that.
        <br />
        In retrospect, I think the way the rest of the rhymes came out didn't really invoke any notions of lightheartedness.
        If anything, I think I had a framework to move further along with the song. The next rhyme is that of 'I've wasted my
        time on a worthless mind.' I really liked how those two words -time and mind- don't actually end the same way but the sound
        of them still fits. The same could be said about the last line ('All I ever had was a shining path'), the end words don't 
        really rhyme but they just fit. Of course, rhyming 'cold' and 'foretold' is much more straightforward. I did want to use
        a line other than 'foretold,' but I also ran into this being a case of not having any better words to say what I needed to
        say.
        <br />
        While the melody structure is practically the same across every set of two lines in the chorus,
        I am particularly fond of how the pre-chorus breaks the rhyming scheme a bit: the first line has a rhyme
        between again and cared despite the fact that cared isn't the last word in the phrase. I think it's
        the way that I sang that phrase that makes the words come off as a rhyme. Then I just don't do it during
        the next two lines, which is good to me because it keeps things interesting.
