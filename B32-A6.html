        My approach to soundtracking the podcast I did with Garrett was to simply add expressive sound effects <br />
        While we completely forgot about using the sound effects on the interface, I added some of in addition to the original synth sounds <br />
        Overall, everything added to the podcast was meant to highlight some section of the conversation or to further set the tone of it. <br />

        There's not that many sections where you'll hear a consistent piece of music in the background, but there is one notable exception: <br />
        There's a part in the podcast where I talk about attending BC years ago, where you'll hear a whole-step scale in the background. <br />
        I really wanted to land that feeling of a flashback or reminiscing a bygone time, so that's why that synth sound goes for as long as it does. <br />
        This is something I did using Ableton's drift synth, where I only needed to use 2 since oscillators with a long release to get something bell-like. <br />
    </p>

        Something else that I did was to add little nods to some of the bands or genres we've brought up. <br />
        There's a section where Garrett talks about worship music, over which I added a C major chord pad to emphasize that. <br />
        My intent with that wasn't necessarily to be funny but to be tongue-in-cheek, which is also how I went about emphasizing other aspects of the podcast. <br />
        There's also a section where we talk about thrash metal and this was a bit hard for me to soundtrack-because I wanted to get a little thrash riff playing over that <br />
        and designing sounds with synths that are thrash-adjacent was not super intuitive for me. I got some inspiration from the 90's DOOM soundtrack since they literally <br />
        turned famous thrash and grunge songs into 8-bit-esque versions. That's a big reason for why the thrash bits sound as vintage as they do. <br />
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Honestly, working on this assignment really put my sense of what things sound like into practice. <br />
        I guess it was a bit easy in the sense that I could figure out what I wanted things to sound like- <br />
        sometimes I think of little sound bytes whenever I'm talking to someone and that definitel helped with coming up with melodies- <br />
        but actually getting the synths to sound exactly how I wanted them to was something else. Like I definitely knew what to do for a lot of <br />
        what I set out to make, but just as with many things in life, I think this is something i'll get better at with time. <br />
        Overall, I had a lot of fun!  <br />
