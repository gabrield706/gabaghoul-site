        1. I would argue that one of the best ways to humanize technology is to use it for a purpose other than what it was originally meant to be used for. 
           I think one artist who’s typically at the forefront of this is Björk, she had a Tesla coil at one of her concerts that played the melody to one of her songs. 
           Tesla coils were originally used for experiments in lighting, X-ray generation, and energy transmission, but it’s cool to think that it was able to be repurposed as a sort of bassy, sawtooth synth.

        2. I think sampling is really unique because it allows anyone to convert one sound and make it sound like a completely different one, 
           play a sound in different pitches to serve as a keyboard or synth, or repurpose a sound to serve a different musical role. 
           You’re not necessarily playing an instrument like a violin or a tuba -which already have fixed sounds- and you’re not adding 
           effects to an instrument to color the sound like is the case with guitar pedals. While you could add audio effects to a sampler, 
           a sampler on its own lets you play with raw sound: you can chop a sound sample into smaller parts, re pitch the sound, reverse it, 
           play slices out of sequence, and do all sorts of manipulations. You can even give songs a new life by making them sound like something 
           completely different, which is what a lot of hip hop artists do.

        3. I think the most challenging part was finding slices (and sequences of slices) that actually sounded pretty good. 
           I’m not familiar with the original Dilla track (let alone the sample source), but I had an initial hard time finding 
           a good set of slices that sounded good together. I settled on something that featured a repeating slice because that 
           felt indicative of timing, and that definitely floated my boat once it came time to record something. The challenge of 
           finding a good sequence, however, was interesting because it really forced my brain to stitch slices up in a relatively 
           creative way.
