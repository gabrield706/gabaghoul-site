            "Kiddie Pool Blues": <br />
            <br />
            VERSE: <br />
            I wanna surf but I live in Bakersfield <br />  
            It's gettin' hot so I guess I'll buy a kiddie pool <br /> 
            Oh oh I'm gonna buy a kiddie pool <br /> 
            <br />
            Yeah <br /> 
            <br /> 
            We ain't got a beach but I'll buy myself a kiddie pool <br /> 
            Oh yeah <br />

        While ther have been plenty of songs through time that use the 12-bar blues,
        I wanted to explore how my voice could sound if I provided it with a different
        instrumental context. I ususally go for the soft crooning approach, but that didn't
        feel right when it came to using the 12-bar blues approach (it feels more upbeat than
        the more dark, spooky stuff I tend to go for). I did my best impression of a blues singer
        over my electric guitar, added some Garageband drums, and came up with something my grandparents
        would've probably digged back in the day. I do want to point out that because I didn't have an
        external mic, I couldn't isolate the metronome when recording the vocals while having my headphones on.
        Nonetheless, I decided to keep the metronome cowbell for texture.

        The lyrics were pretty absurd, this somewhat comes from a place of not being able
        to fit any instrospective meanings to the vibe of the 12-bar blues, and I do like
        maintaining a balance of not taking myself too seriously, artistically speaking
        (I heard Tool are good at doing that and they still feel pretty profound to me).
        It was hot when I recorded the track so I used that for inspiration-the fact that
        we're in California but far from the beach felt ironic, and the idea of settling
        for a kiddie pool felt kind of funny. Overall, I ended up with something that feels
        like a tongue-in-cheek version of a stereotypical Beach Boys song.
