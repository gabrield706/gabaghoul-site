    <h1>Synth Assignment 3</h1>

        I made a small recording using only the Nord and some Ableton audio effects. <br />
        I recorded three separate tracks using a portable 1st gen iRig for guitar (probably why the tracks have some crackles in it):. <br />
        A melodic track using the Panpipes setting on the Nord's synth sample engine, a chord track using the pipe organ, and a bassline track using the B3 model.  <br />

        When I recorded the Nord tracks, I used a preset called Jazzy Click B for the bassline. <br />
        I wanted it to sound a bit more washed out and gritty so I added a lot of chorus and a bit of drive. <br />
        The end result was quite crunchy with a bit of an early Frank Ocean vibe going on towards the end. <br />

        As I learned to work with the Nord, I realized how much more it had in common with an actual organ than a traditional synth. <br />
        Of course you had a few ADSR controls and an effect section, but the idea of using the drawbars to add and subtract overtones was a bit new to me. <br />
        Also, the lack of a sequencer gave it away that this instrument was intended for a more traditional keyboard player (which I am not lol). <br />

        Despite the theory of operation being a bit different for me, I did end up using the drawbars to get rid of the bass tones for the pipe chords.  <br />
        After I recorded everything, I ended up spending a decent chunk of time aligning the tracks and using warp to get everything synchronized. <br />
        I brought everything down except the panpipes, but I brought the bassline down significantly because that track gave me clipping issues. <br />
        I also used compression to get around this, so that I wouldn't lose too much of the sound itself. I was ok with everything after that,<br />
        but I also wanted to go abit crazy with the panning-simply because that harsh bass sound at the end demanded it.  <br />
        I threw an auto-pan effect on buth the bassline and the pipe chords, but I only wanted them to come in near the end. I think the end result came out fine, almost like a segue into another song.  <br />
