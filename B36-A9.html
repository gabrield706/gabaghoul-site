        Content and Strategies (1/3):
        ghouligan is an independent singer/songwriter who blends goth, metal, Latin, and electronic influences
        across his work. While his musical propositions may have been achieved before, ghouligan's artistic approach
        primarily centers around achieving soundscapes by repurposing sounds or genre ideas. The official ghouligan
        logo was previously shown in the website's main page but has been removed until he has established the copyright.
        The logo itself was inspired by an image from the Nazca lines that resembles a waving humanoid figure, part of the idea was
        to not only adopt an official and easily-recognizable logo, but have an image that could be easy to market as a t-shirt.
        A perfect example of this is the famous Joy Division shirts featuring their first album's cover, these t-shirts were
        highily popular due to the album cover's design alone yet it did a lot to promote the band decades after their separation.
    </p>


    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Content and Strategies (2/3):
        I could stock up on 20 or so T-shirts but before actually selling merch, however, I will need to 
        create the point of sales. While I could integrate a store into my site after some heavy computer work, 
        having shows will be the most important factor for generating merch sales. This brings me to the topic 
        of live shows, which I feel would be harder for me to achieve from the start. Having only lived in Bakersfield
        for about a year and a half now, there aren't many connections I feel I could leverage to quickly 
        navigate the local music scene. What I do have to my advantage, however, is that I'm not only in consistent 
        contact with music faculty through the commercial music program, but my current job at Guitar Center also allows
        me to frequently come across other local musicians. I've only worked about a month there and am getting to know
        my co-workers a bit more, I'm confident that I could make a venue connection within three to four months. At the
        same time, however, I wouldn't want to approach networking from a selfish standpoint; I wouldn't mind lending any 
        production skills I have in service of other artists as well (this also touches upon one of my mission statement of 
        becoming more known as a producer).

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Content and Strategies (3/3):
        One thing that I strongly feel that I need to consider (which I believe was also covered during week 4), is the
        content that I will have readily available by the time I get to form venue connections and the like. I experienced
        something similar first-hand, after one of the commercial music professors introduced me via email to a music professor
        at UC Irvine. Not only was I able to share my work with him via my website, but I was also able to share a link to an article
        about a past internship with him. I held on to that article link for safe-keeping, and being able to share that makes the experience
        come off a lot more legitimate than if I were to simply say that I've done that thing. In this same vein, I'll need to have material
        ready for contacts of interest to check out when booking shows. While I have plenty of unfinished songs that need to be worked on,
        I'm strongly thinking that I could focus on two or three originals and seriously have some covers down as early repertoire.
        So in addition to publishing three songs on streaming services, I could record about five or four cover videos and post them
        across social media.

        Marketing:
        My marketing strategy primarily revolves around social media but with a slightly-less conventinal approach. 
        I definitely want to promote my performances and original work but I think that changing this apporach a bit could
        be very helpful in meeting at least two of my three goals. I have a handful of song ideas that I've produced
        over the years but never actually released because they contain samples. It was actually through the Pat Corcoran
        video that I got the idea about potentially releasing an uncleared album for free-to start generating an audience.
        Basically, I would finish a bunch of instrumental song ideas and release them for free (via YouTube/SoundCloud); this
        would literally be the culmination of years of semi-passive work I've been doing since high school and undergrad, and 
        I wouldn't mind not making money from it since finishing these tracks should be quicker than writing my own songs.
        I get one of four albums down and put my production techniques out there, but of course I would also expect myself
        to finish my flagship songs and post live performances in tandem. This free album, however, will need an album cover
        for which I will need an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.

    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Marketing Budget:
        1. Adobe Creative Cloud Student Plan - $20/month ($60 for three months)
        2. ghouligan Custom T-Shirt (merch) - $15/shirt ($300 for 20 shirts on CustomInk)
        3. Total  - $360 across three months

       Competition:
       Although I haven't seen many current acts blending goth and metal influences with Latin rhythms,
       I do get a feeling that this could be a fairly-easy proposition that other starting artists could
       come by. I did find a band a few days ago called Doombia that blends cumbia rhythms with doom metal and
       post-punk, but after a few listens I came to the realization that their sound wasn't quite what I envision
       for me. A big reason for that is because I would be performing and writing songs as a solo act, and a lot
       of my original compositions are done with my DAW and guitar as opposed to jamming with others. 
       Outside of Doombia, it doesn't seem like there's many Gen Z acts capitalizing on a Latin goth sound. 
       What's been really popular within alternative Gen Z'ers during the last five years has been shoegaze,
       and there's already plenty of bands out there trying to sound like My Bloody Valentine or Slowdive.
       The post-punk and darkwave scenes have really been dominated by the likes of Molchat Doma and Twin Tribes,
       but their sounds are a lot more rooted in synthpop than what I usually incorporate.
