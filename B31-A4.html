            "Control Over Self": <br />
            <br />
            When I’m down <br />
            I look in your eyes <br />
            And I can hardly recognize myself <br />
            <br />
            When I’m down <br />
            You’ll look in my eyes <br />
            Like you’re satisfied with yourself <br />
            <br />
            Will you have enough? <br />
            Could you get enough? <br />
            Will you have enough? <br />
            Could you get enough? <br />
            Will you have enough? <br />
            Could you get enough? <br />
            Will you have enough  <br />
            long after I’ve gone? <br />
            <br />
            Wouldn’t you want to be? <br />
            Anyone else or free? <br />
            Wouldn’t you like to see? <br />
            Through your eyes what’s become of me? <br />
            <br />
            Whenever you want is not forever <br />
            Whenever you want is not forever <br />
            Whenever you want is not forever <br />
            Whenever you want is not forever <br />

            Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-du-du <br />
            Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-du-du <br />

        I went into the assignment with a pre-existing guitar riff (the one from the intro), and without anything else.
        I tried to create riffs with a completely different structure, but I was surprised to hear how cohesive everything
        sounded when stitched together. 
        <br />
        The intro riff is also the main riff (as it repeats itself twice during the song),
        it goes from a G minor chord to a Bb minor chord and those chords aren't used again. I also took the liberty of
        changing the lyrics for each time this part comes on, since I wanted to express movement and progress throughout
        the song. The first lyrical section goes over looking into someone's eyes and getting a sense of manipulation.
        I have to admit that I went into the lyrcis with this theme as a sort of driving force for the lyrics, but I didn't
        want that theme to be made completely obvious throughout any of the lyrics. I wanted to make them vague enough
        for listeners to be able to draw their own interpretations of what the lyrics could actually mean.
        <br />
        The 'will you have enough' part of the song goes from what I think is an F# diminished chord to an F diminished chord.
        The lyrics for this part came to me before the lyrics for the begiining of the song, and at this point I was just playing
        with how I could make my voice sound different. My voice drops lower during the 'could you get enough' parts, which I thought
        was pretty interesting. Even though I got the idea from my sister who will sometimes do cute voices and quickly replace them
        with low growls, the result reminded me a bit of an Oingo Boingo song I heard a while back- I just can't remember which one
        but I remember he did that sort of thing with his voice.
        <br />
        During the last repetition of the main riff ('wouldn'y you want to be'), I approached it as if it were the song's chorus.
        I really capitalized on rhymes at this point, which felt a bit cheesy to me in hindsight but it does fit. I do have to
        admit that I made this part more lyrically closer to the song's beginning, since both lyrical sections were done over
        the same guitar riff.
        <br />
        'Whatever you want is not forever.' I put this phrase together because the lyrical melody came to me first.
        There wasn't really a meaning behind it when it came to me, but I guess it could serve like some kind
        of defensive statement against the manipulator in question. Having mentioned this, this entire concept
        really seemed to fit in with the riff for this part: a somewhat somber A minor to E major-based guitar
        line. From the way everything just came together during this point in the song, I would have to say
        this is my favorite section.
        <br />
        The very last song section is just pure hums, but the melody changes for this one. While it uses the same progression
        from before, the melody feels a tad creepier and more mysterious; I really wanted the guitar to become more of
        a focus at this point which is basically why I just decided to hum this part out. The overall result invokes
        a sense of being in a trance-at least when I've listened to it, and for the song to end in this sort of mysterious
        way is perfect enough for me.
