        I really enjoyed how Ableton put this series of lessons together. <br />
        It reminded me a lot of when I first started learning music theory in high school, except that I wish I had access to a one-stop shop for simplified breakdowns like these. <br />
        This being said, I noticed myself getting caught up in the technicalities behind some concepts, such as the difference between a voicing and an inversion. <br />
        For example, the site defined voicings as chord shapes with multiple instances of the same note, but then the picture above shows inversions of Cmin7 without the repeating root note. <br />
        Maybe it's because I did jazz band for three years and the band director glossed over this, but I'd like to really figure this out at some point.

        On a less semantic-related note, I liked the breakdown of the "Around the World" <br />
        I remember trying to learn it on bass once and having some difficulty with it, because I had to jump around the fretboard to play it <br />
        But seeing it on the sequencer made it feel a lot more tame, and to be fair it does just ascend three times and descends at the last bar <br />
        It's still one of my favorite basslines and I never would have derived those chords from it alone-without listening to the entire track <br />
        Speaking of repeating phrases, the song "Award Tour" had me thinking a bit about how many phrases are enough to make a good song. <br />
        I've always liked A Tribe Called Quest since the first time I was introduced to them, and although the phrases they tend to sample might <br />
        seem like a few, their sample choices always seem to catch my ear even as I listen through their lyrics. <br />
        I'm one of those guitarists that tends to 'noodle' a lot and have a habit of making up a lot of new phrases when I make songs. <br />
        Listening to the Tribe track, however, brought me back to the value of simplicity.
