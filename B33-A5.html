    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        I used the vocal, snare, and acoustic guitar tracks for this particular assignment. <br />
        I really wanted to try working compression into a vocal track because it felt like the most straightforward use case to me. <br />
        The singer definitely got a tad bit loud at times and we just wanted to bring that down by a hair; I did start off with a 4:1 ratio <br />
        and with the threshold at -10dB, but since the track never hit that threshold, I lowered it to -16dB to check out the difference. <br />
        It turned out that with the threshold at -16dB, the more melodic parts of the vocals felt detailed out more with everything remaining the same.<br />
        That's pretty much the only reason I wanted to keep the compressor, which was very different from my approach with the acoustic guitar.  <br />
        As far as the acoustic guitar, I initially thought of just compressing that significantly to that the vocals could get noticed more. <br />
        I used the suggested 4:1 ratio and ended up with the threshold at -17dB just because I wanted to try reducing the guitar significantly enough.  <br />
        This was to let the vocals be heard more, and while I thought that lowering the threshold more would be better, I went back to -17 because balance would end up missing.  <br />
        The last thing I compressed was the snare drum, which turned out to be really simple to achieve. While the recommended ratio was 6:1,  <br />
        I just kept the ratio at 4:1 because I didn't feel like the drums had to be that punchy. At the recommended -15dB threshold,  <br />
        the snare was punchy enough to let the vocals shine through. <br />
