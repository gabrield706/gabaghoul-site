    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        My most favorite example of a song that samples another has to be Gustavo Cerati's Bocanada.
        During the late 90's, Argentinean singer/songwriter and Latin rock legend Gustavo Cerati had 
        come out of the breakup of iconic Latin rock band Soda Stereo and fully embarked on his own solo career.
        Largely influenced by the UK trip-hop and IDM scenes of that era, Cerati had temporarily set his guitar
        aside in favor of the Akai MPC 3000 and a wide array of synthesizers. Cerati experimented heavily with 
        electronic sounds during his post-Soda Stereo period (and even before, apparently), with the end result being
        his 1999 album "Bocanada."
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        The title track itself is downtempo and atmosphere-heavy, serving as a sort of soundtrack to a smoking-induced silence between
        two lovers that Cerati narrates with a Sinatra-like croon. A large part of the song's sonic atmosphere comes from the sampling of
        one section from Eruption, a 1971 track from the Ducth prog-rock band Focus. After hearing the two tracks closely, it very
        much sounds like that particular part of Eruption had been pitched up and sliced into multiple sub parts. When compared to
        Eruption, the sub parts sound like they're being played out of sequence in Bocanada. The way Cerati made use of these sub parts
        is very interesting, because it almost seems like he allowed the chords and chord changes heard in these slices to guide
        Bocanada's musical direction (the vocal melody, bass, and layered synths seem to work around this).
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Focus themselves came up with the original chord progressions and sonic textures found in the sample, but Cerati's genius
        not only lies in his rearrangement of these progressions but in the soundscape he was able to create from the overall song.
        Whereas that section from Eruption might feel jazzy, melancholic, and psychedelic, Bocanada has this relaxing "noir" feel that
        feels more invested in atmosphere. This being mentioned, I do feel that the Focus sample does contribute largely to Bocanada itself.
        When played live, Cerati had always used his MCP to play the samples but even there there's been an orchestral rendition of the song itself.
        The orchestral version has the same progressions from the original but lacks the melodic nuances provided by the Focus sample (most likely
        due to copyright). In my opinion, this is noticeable enough to where it feels hard to digest the idea of detatching the sample from the song.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Cerati sampled a song section that was largely made up of chords being played on a mellotron. Since my remix partner's track
        was primarily a series of pad chords with a melody, I took that same sampling approach as a basis for how to manipulate
        my partner's track. I pitched his track up and while I didn't slice much of it, I played the same slice across different pitches
        for a more melodic effect. The remix approach itself took some time for me to arrive to, at first all I could think of doing with
        the sample was to make a Frank Ocean-type beat, but then I came up with the reverbed bongos because I wanted the track to have
        some sort of spooky feel to it. I used the same drum and bass sounds from Coco Levante because I felt like I could build upon
        the bongos well with that, and finished off with my reverb guitar sample from earlier. I really wanted to use that sample more
        than I had before because it just sounds really nice; although it's definitely not the centerpiece of this remix, I feel that it
        adds a certain texture to it that eventually helped me break the song structure on the later half.
