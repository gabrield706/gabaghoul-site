    <h1>Live Event 2</h1>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        As part of my job as a Guitar Center instructor, I have the opportunity to encourage my students to perform at our quarterly recitals. <br />
        Since they already knew that I was a student at BC, I asked them a couple of weeks ago if I could assist with the event's live sound for this assignment.  <br />
        I found out earlier this week that I got the green light, and I just came home today from shadowing my assistant supervisor as they mixed the event.  <br />
        I am super thankful to them, my direct manager, and the store manager for allowing me to sit in and work behind the mixer (and still get paid for it!). <br />
    </p>

        The recital took place at Temblor Brewery and I started working there at 2:30pm and finished at 5:00pm. <br />
        The stage setup was already taken care of by people who worked the event earlier, so I myself wasn't too acquainted with <br />
        the exact stage setup (with the exception of the pictures shown above that I took during my downtime). At Guitar Center, <br />
        we teach students how to play guitar, bass, piano, and drums so we were set to have combinations of those instruments throughout different time slots, <br />
        and sometimes we had multiple students that played as a band or as a group. Our total stage setup consisted of one drumset, two mic'd Line 6 Spider guitar amps  <br />
        (very high quality), a Fender Rumble bass amp running into a passive Radial DI, a mic'd Boss Katana guitar amp, a keyboard, and two vocal mics.  <br />
        I should note that we also had two acoustic guitars with built-in pickups and 1/4 inch outputs, so we plugged these into the guitar amps instead of having them play into mics <br />
        (I don't know why this decision was made but my guess is that that might have required using more DIs than we had available, which is a bit ironic since <br />
        we are Guitar Center and we technically do have "everything" we could possibly need at our disposal, but we still have limits on what equipment we're allowed to use). <br />    
        We also had four monitors on stage: three at the front and facing the performers, and a dedicated drum monitor on the side of the drum kit. <br />
        One thing I should note about the drums is that the kick, snare, rack tom, floor tom, and hi-hat were mic'd but we had no overheads. <br />
        According to my assistant manager, this is because the venue's acoustics already amplified the other cymbals enough, so there was no need to further mix those. <br />
        This was really intriguing to me and I can make sense of it, but since I don't have that kind of experience mixing live sound, I couldn't really pick up on a difference. <br />
        Last but not least, we used two large PA speakers for the front of house mix (I believe they were QSCs since those are usually what we keep in the store for events).  <br />

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        Now on to the mixer itself, we used a Midas M32 for this event. A few days before the event, I told my assistant supervisor that we were <br />
        a Behringer X32 mixer in our live sound class, and then they told me that the Midas M32 was actually what the X32 aimed to replicate <br />
        Apparently both Midas and Behringer are owned by the same parent company so I guess there's rationale for that, but overall, what my supervisor  <br />
        meant to tell me was that the theory of operation was relatively similar to that of an X32 console. The console was of course digital so there were <br />
        additional channels we could pull up depending on what our needs were. The mixer pictures show five drum channels along with three additional tom tracks  <br />
        (those tracks were meant for something my supervisor was trying to do but they ended up scraping them for some reason-so they stayed muted), <br />
        and channels 9-14 were used for the bass, three guitars, and the keyboard. I didn't get a chance to take a picture of it, but vocal tracks 1 and 2 <br />
        were on channels 17 and 18 respectively, and we also used aux tracks 1 and 2 for our backing track channels. My supervisor did have an iPad and router with them, <br />
        but we ended up not really needing to use it since we were alreay receiving visual cues from our direct supervisor to get certain things going. <br />
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        I have to admit that mxing the actual event was a little weird for me to achieve, since my supervisor found themselves working under too much pressure <br />
        to just hand over the reins and let me do my thing. Nonetheless, they were super helpful with explaining the flow of things as well as why they configured <br />
        channels and busses the way they did. One thing that they had me do was to mute the drum monitor mix every time there were no drummers on stage. This wasn't just for practicality <br />
        but because leaving it on could create feedback if the monitor mix was captured by the other mics. We were also exclusively using reverb and delay FX <br />
        sends for vocals, which we always wanted to turn off every time our direct supervisor used a mic to announce the next act. We were definitel concerned about <br />
        feedback, but we also wanted to make sure the backing tracks were sequenced with the performers. There was one instance where we had one kid playing the drums <br />
        to the Pokemon theme song, and I had to wait for the drum instructor to cue me in to start the backing track. He wanted us tofade out after the song's first chorus, <br />
        but just as the kid started playing, I noticed he as out of sync. I brought his monitor mix up a bit and he quickly corrected himself, but I guess I didn't fade out <br />
        fast enough because the backing track kept playing a bit after where I had to stop it, so I muted those tracks as fast as I could. <br />
        For the most part, the supervisor had me mix the piano students because I really had to raise and lower their volume a bit (and maybe cut some high frequencies at times). <br />
        There was one act featuring two siblings -one on drums and the other on piano- that I had a lot of fun mixing. They were playing an original piece that started with the piano. <br />
        So far so good, because I didn't have to adjust the track too much. Once the drums came in, the piece became this epic, semi-classical ballad I didn't see coming, and I found myself <br />
        really wanting to bring out the drummer's double pedal. When that came up more, I brought it up above other elements except the piano, and there were moments were I really wanted more crash and hi-hat. <br />
        This was harder to achieve because of the lack of overheads (I guess we didn't see this type of thing coming), but I ended up bringing the hi-hat up a bit since that mic was somewhat close to the crash. <br />
        Overall, there were multiple mixing instances that we had to account for. While my supervisor ended up doing most of the harder mixes (like mixing three guitars and a voice), <br />
        there were unexpected instances that were huge mind openeers as far as what to consider for different mixing secnarios. We had some unprecedented changes in our setlist where some <br />
        'unplanned' acts featuring the last performer would come up, and we'd have to mix them quick. All in all, I could understand why a live setting like a recital could have kept <br />
        my supervisor as busy was they were (and why they probably overlooked at having me do some stuff), but I ultimately learned a lot about mixing a live event where the performers are also students. <br />
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        I really can't emphasize enough how thankful I am to Guitar Center for letting me sit in on the recital sound mixing. <br />
        Throughout most of the event, it was in the back of my mind that I would normally be teaching during those hours, and there were lots of times where I felt like I wasn't really doing anything. <br />
        The main reason I was brought on was so that my supervisor could take breaks between sets but even then they were so caught up with the work, and my other co-workers were pretty much running around as well.  <br />
        It definitely felt like a priviledge to 'intern' the way that I did, and I'd be happy to be more involed in future recitals if the opportunity presents itself. <br />
        Working live sound definitely requires an experienced ear, and a lot of what I've done through this class has definitely led to that. <br />
        Something really cool that came up from this experience was that I learned that my assistant supervisor also works for an event company that does live sound. <br />
        If I need to work on another live sound assignment again, there's an open invitation to work an event with them if one comes up. <br />
