        I made a small recording using only the Korg Volca Sample and some DAW effects. <br />
        Rather that playing different instruments on each track, I played a different sequence on each to create more interesting mixes. <br />
        The overall result feels more experimental that straightforward but I enjoyed making it nonetheless. <br />

        I had a lot of fun with the Volca's setp jump mode, the stutters were so fun and easy to do which is a bit odd, <br />
        because hearing stutters like that always gave me the impression of something that was hard to program for some reason. <br />
        Because of that feature though, I really leaned into an Aphex Twin/Björk kind of sound for that recording. <br />

        I didn't think much of it, but adding overdrive to that stuttery percussion really colored the sound more. <br />
        The stutters were done over the clap sequence from the 'claps' track, and those stutters just sound much more agressive. <br />

        I used a new sequence for the melodic track, which I made using a square wave sample and the motion sequence function.  <br />
        That also had its own kick drum but adding some flanger gave it a bit more of a 'squishy' sound to it. <br />
        I normally don't go for more experimental electronic sounds like those, but I just went with the Björk vibe on that one. <br />
        Overall, even after buying a unit, I'm still amazed by what's possible with the Volca Sample.  <br />
        As someone who eventually wants to play his original stuff live, I feel like the Volca would be a great option for integrating  <br />
        fast and heavy electronic percussion sounds.  <br />
