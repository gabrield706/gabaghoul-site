        I went to assist the sound check for BC's fall jazz concert on November 17th; this was at the indoor theater at the performing arts building. <br />
        I got the chance to set up the stage's audio connections and to mix the audio for the house and monitor speakers;
        I got to use a Yamaha DM7 Compact as the mixer for the event, and we had a total of 15 inputs going into it. <br />
        We had about three jazz ensembles that played throughout the sound check, which required audio setup to be somewhat adaptable <br />
        between bands. While every ensemble had an essential roster of musicians -a drummer, a guitarist, a bassist, a pianist, and 4 horns- <br />
        some bands would have slightly more musicians or they might need an extra mic available for a particular solo.   <br />
        While our stage and channel setup had already been settled on what appears below, we also had the flexibility to <br />
        temporarily use certain mics for other instruments as needed. <br />
    </p>

        Something I found interesting about this setup was that we had a second bass amp in our setup (as shown below). <br />
        The Markbass amp was routed to our main bass channel, and seeing that we had a Fender Rumble reserved for what could <br />
        only be the second guitar channel, I figured at first that maybe the Rumble was actually reserved for a second <br />
        electric guitar. Eventually, we did have one band that had two bassists, but even though only one played at a time,  <br />
        I figured that in the event that two guitars or two basses were needed, the Rumble could accommodate to either scenario  <br />
        (since you can plug an electric guitar into a bass amp, and guitars sound particularly good through a Rumble amp).  <br />
        We did, however, need to use a Radial active DI box in the event that passive bass pickups would be used. We did have an   <br />
        issue with the first band, since their electric bass actually had an active pickup; that signal was going   <br />
        through the active DI, and since that DI was receiving phantom power from the mixer, we had to disable it for the active DI in order  <br />
        for the original signal to go through. That got us by, but then there was one instance where one of the ensembles was using an   <br />
        upright bass with a passive pickup. We just had to turn the phantom power back on to get our signal. <br />

        There were some considerable changes we had to account for in real time. As far as the house mix, the biggest thing we had  <br />
        to tweak in real time was the vocal channel for one of the bands. After the second band started rehearsing, we noticed <br />
        that even with her channel at base level (-5 dB), the singer was still loud enough to potentially over-drive the house speakers a bit.  <br />
        We ended up adding a compressor instance to the vocal channel and lowered the threshold a bit; I thought this was particularly  <br />
        effective because the singer gave a very emotional performance, and while that would most likely have been harder to achieve <br />
        with a softer voice, that emotional timbre was still there after the compression-you could very much still feel her performance <br />
        even if her voice wasn't overpowering the house mix anymore. While that was a big mind-opener as to how to mix live vocals,  <br />
        the more consistent challenge (at least for me) lied within mixing the rhythm section. Throughout all three bands, the drums and bass <br />
        were straightforward to mix since their presence was always a must. But for instruments like guitar and piano, I found that it was <br />
        easier for them to get lost in the mix whenever the horns played (which, for jazz, was like 90% of the time). Bringing up the guitar and   <br />
        piano was easier during individual brass solos, but making them easier to hear did feel harder to do without bringing the horns  <br />
        down too much. Maybe panning across the house speakers could have helped achieve that balance, but that wasn't something we hadn't <br />
        dabbled too much with at this stage in the class. Overall, I felt that because the horns and percussive instruments were already loud enough and the theater <br />
        was small enough to allow for enough sound dispersal, I settled on bringing the guitar, bass, piano, and vocals up more through the house mix. <br />
        I somewhat figured that this would at least compensate for the horns potentially overshadowing the other instruments; by making those <br />
        slightly louder through the house mix, it would at least be easier to hear them even if their sound came from above the brass sections.<br />
