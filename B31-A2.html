            "Grass": <br />
            <br />
            VERSE: <br />
            I'm looking at a bunch of grass <br />  
            It's very green <br /> 
            But is it even greener on the other side? <br /> 
            <br />
            On the other side <br /> 
            <br /> 
            Isn't it nice <br /> 
            To finally touch some? <br /> 
            But when I'm there <br /> 
            I'm still trapped inside my head <br /> 
            <br /> 
            On the other side <br />
            <br />
            CHORUS: <br />
            And I go outside <br />
            Because I’m loosing my mind <br />
            And the voices won’t stop <br />
            Something’s crawling in my head <br />
            <br />
            Now I’m under the light <br />
            And the air feels fine <br />
            And it’s all okay <br />
            Because I’m finally on the other side <br />
            <br />
            On the other side <br />
            
        </p>
    </p>

        The lyrics for this song came from looking at grass outside my window.
        I started playing around with grass-related sayings (ex. "grass is always greener", "touch grass"),
        and eventually I got to a point where the song became about someone on the verge of madness until they
        go outside and touch grass. This is what made my chorus go into a creepy vibe, sice I figure I could've expanded
        on that idea there. I made the song in the key of E and used I-V for my verse, and iii-IV for my chorus.
