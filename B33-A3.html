    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        I based my stage plot and input list off of the band I'm in. <br />
        We formed only a few months ago and haven't played any events yet, so I thought this assignment <br />
        would be a great opportunity to model what that would look like. <br />
        We're a four-piece band that currently plays post-punk, indie, and yacht rock, <br />
        and some of us have more than one role in the band (I kept the other band members' names anonymous) <br />
        While I only play guitar in the band (sometimes lead and sometimes rhythm), our frontman <br />
        also switches between guitar and keys while singing. Our bassist does backing vocals as well <br />
        and our drumer has a pretty standard setup. I based the plot off of an example from the reference site <br />
        as well as from our own practice setup. While we don't have that many monitors, I figured we would certainly need <br />
        that many. We currently don't have DI boxes for the bass and keyboard, but of course we'll need that for line leveling. <br />
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        The input list was based off of that same setup; the most basic mic setup for the drummer <br />
        would be the two overhead mics and the kick drum, while everything else was pretty straightforward. <br />
        I treated every mix as if they represented the mixes going into each band member's monitor: <br />
        1 for the drummer, 2 for the bassist, 3 for myself, and 4 for the frontman.  <br />
        I figured that for the drummer's monitor mix, they would need to not only hear themselves but the bassist  <br />
        as well, since the bassist is also in charge of contributing to the rhythm. Similarly, it would be more essential  <br />
        for the bassist to listen to the drummer for rhythmic guidance, as well as the vocals to get a sense of lyrical progress.   <br />
        As the primary guitarist (myself), I felt like it would make more sense for me to hear the kick drum and the two vocals  <br />
        to get the most barebones guidance for performing songs; however, as I look back I'm thinking that getting the bass in the mix  <br />
        would really help towards identifying key changes. Last but not least, I included the kick and my guitar into the frontman's mix  <br />
        to help avoid any overlapping guitar parts. He should also be able to listen to both vocals for the same reason, but I would also <br />
        retroactively include the bass track to help with key signatures. <br />
