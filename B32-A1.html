        I haven't been tweaking synths at a profund level so reviewing the Ableton guide definitely helped with a few things I've been confused about. <br />
        The first thing being decay and sustain. It might sound a bit obvious but both just felt like the same to me for a while. <br />
        Of course, the big distinction to make is that decay refers to how the sound changes after the attack, up until reaching the sustain level. <br />
        This gets a bit tricky, but basically the sustain level is what your sound ends up like while you're still pressing on to a note. <br />
        For example, immediately after pressing a key, the pitch might go up to A2 and then down to D1. Once it stays at D1, that would <br />
        mean we've reached the sustain level, and I get this D1 pitch up until I let go. The I reach the release level of sound evolution. <br />

        I had a good refresher on the theme of envelope generators. <br />
        Of course envelopes can be used to change pitch or amplitude, but I'm wondering if some synths might have envelopes for changing other parts of a sound. <br />
        I guess one parameter could be the LFO- maybe there are some envelopes that let you tweak the LFO rate over time or something like that. <br />
        Generally, LFO parameters (other than rate and level) have been hard for me to wrap my head around. I'm hoping I can see some more examples of <br />
        advance LFO usage soon.. However, I'm not too sure if I'll be tweaking envelopes or LFO a lot when it comes to my own original music. <br />
        I ntocied that tend to prefer a lot of minimal and 'short-attack' synth sounds, so I might spend more time tweaking synth timbres. <br />
