        I thought the assignment was a lot of fun. It was so much easier to identify the filter <br />
        with the pink noise since the brightness and darkness of it all was a lot easier to notice.  <br />
        My thought process with it all was to first pick up on whether the sound was more quiet or loud first, <br />
        since this gave me some direction of where the filter loudness was supposed to go.   <br />
        At least with boost, the louder frequencies were easier to pinpoint but in cut,
        choosing a rock band sound sample didn't help much because with all of the instrument <br />
        frequencies being all over the place. I used one of my synth recordings for boost/cut <br />
        mode and I think identifying the filter got a bit better, since the sound was a lot more uniform. <br />
        While I didn't feel much of an issue switching between filter modes, it definitely became more <br />
        challenging when I got to work with audio where the fequencies varied a lot more. <br />
